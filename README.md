## Features

- Define your uniforms 1 time in [state.js](./js/state.js) and use them in both the shader and the UI without needing to update them in your render loop.

- Easily add UI for your uniforms in [ui.js](./js/ui.js).

- Uses a [single triangle](https://michaldrobot.com/2014/04/01/gcn-execution-patterns-in-full-screen-passes/) to render the shader to the screen for optimization instead of a Quad.

- There's a nifty helper function [createMeshWithUniforms](./js/shaderCreationHelpers.js) that handles updating all your uniforms from your state every frame so you don't need to update them in your render loop.
